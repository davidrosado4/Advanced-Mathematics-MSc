# Dynamical Systems
The assignment of this subject was based on multiple deliviries. You can find two folders containing the main blocks of the course:
1. **One dimensional and complex dynamics**
   + Introduction to dynamical systems, discrete and continuous. Basic terminology. Conjugacies.
   + Dynamical systems in real dimension 1. Introduction and examples. Bifurcations. Bimodal maps: the quadratic family. Circle homeomorphisms.
   + Dynamical Systems on the complex plane. Riemann surfaces and iteration of holomorphic functions.Normal families: The Fatou and Julia sets. Local theory: periodic points and linearization. Global theory: connected components of the Fatou set. Parameter spaces: the Mandelbrot set and main conjectures.

2. **N-dimensional dynamics**
   + Lyapunov stability.
   + Local theory: Hartman’s Theorem, Sternberg’s Theorem and invariant manifolds.
   + Normal forms and bifurcations.
   + Hyperbolic dynamics.
