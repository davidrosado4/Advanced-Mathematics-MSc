The assignment of this subject was based on multiple theoretical exercises and a final project. Here we focus on the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equation and applications,
the Harmonic functions and the Dirichlet problem, the Subharmonic functions and zeros of holomorphic functions and in Functions of several variables; Local theory.
