# Harmonic Analysis
The assignment of this subject was based on multiple theoretical exercises and multiple programming exercises. Here, we focus on Fourier Series,
Orthonormal basis and L2 theory, Convergence of the series. Fourier transform; Sampling theorem. Convolution operators; Fourier multipliers. 
Applications: Radon transform; Linear PDEâ€™s and Wavelets. Finally, the programming part in MATLAB.
