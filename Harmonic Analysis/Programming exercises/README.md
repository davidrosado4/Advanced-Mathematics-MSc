# Programming exercises
Here you can find the programming exercises made in Octave, an open source similar to MATLAB. 
+ ``Exercise 1``. We work on removing noise from  some COVID data and GPS data using different filters. 
+ ``Exercise 2``. We work on removing noise from an audio. 
+ ``Exercise 3``. We work on an algorithm for multiplying two polynomials using the Fast Fourier Transform and its inverse. Moreover, we use this algorithm to compute the total number of triplets formed by the initial 100,000 prime numbers.
+ ``Exercise 4``. We work on the scracth implementation of the iradon function to reconstruct some images.
+ ``Exercise 5``. We work on compressed sensing by finding the coeffecients of a sparse polynomial with a few assumptions.
+ ``Exercise 6``. We work on sound compression using wavelets.
