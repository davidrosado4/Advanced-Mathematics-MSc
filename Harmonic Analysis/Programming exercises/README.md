# Programming exercises
Here you can find the programming exercises made in Octave, an open source similar to MATLAB. On the first exercise, we work on removing noise from 
some COVID data and GPS data using different filters. On the second exercise, we work on removing noise from an audio. On the third exercise, we work on an algorithm for multiplying
two polynomials using the Fast Fourier Transform and its inverse. Moreover, we use this algorithm to compute the total number of triplets formed by the initial 100,000 prime numbers.
