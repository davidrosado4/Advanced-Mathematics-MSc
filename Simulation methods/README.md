# Simulation Methods
The assigment of this subject was based on multiple assigments. Here, we focus on integration methods for initial value problems for ODEs, applications to detect regularity/chaos, stability/instability, to compute periodic orbits and other invariant objects, 
continuation of invariant objects and analysis of bifurcations, variational methods and finite elements for PDE, finite difference methods
for PDEs: Partial discretization and time-space discretizations and finally, introduction to the effect of random terms and to Montecarlo methods.

**Final mark:9/10**
