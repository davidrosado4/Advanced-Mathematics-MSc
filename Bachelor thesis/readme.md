Here you can find my research done in my bachelor's degree of mathematics in Universitat de Barcelona. I worked with Newton's method in the Complex plane.
More precisely, I studied some theoretical issues regarding to Newton's method, in which I introduced myself into Holomorphic Dynamics and then, I give a 
new numerical approximation to compute roots of a polynomial. Nevertheless, no theoretical support of my new approximation is provided, I am currently
working on this...

The final mark is 9.8
