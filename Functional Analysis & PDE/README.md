# Functional Analysis and Partial Differential Equations

The assignment of this course was based on multiple deliveries and a final exam. The deliveries consists on theoretical exercises and the final exam was about topics covered during the course. Some of theme are: 
Hilbert spaces: orthogonality, duality and elementary spectral theory. Banach spaces: boundedness of linear operators.  Sobolev spaces: Regularity and compactness and Applications to PDE.
